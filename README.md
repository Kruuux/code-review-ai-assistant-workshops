## Description

The purpose of these workshops is to demonstrate selected code scanning tools. We will be basing on a ready repository with popular vulnerabilities and bugs.

- [Chapter 1](./chapters/chapter-1/README.md) - Repository and vulnerabilities walkthrough
- [Chapter 2](./chapters/chapter-2/README.md) - CodeGuru Reviewer
- [Chapter 3](./chapters/chapter-3/README.md) - CodeGuru Security
- [Chapter 4](./chapters/chapter-4/README.md) - GitHub Code scanning
- [Chapter 5](./chapters/chapter-5/README.md) - Snyk

These workshops are for you if:

- you have never used code scanning tools yourself
- you haven't configured them yourself
- you have only used dependabot

If you have already used the tools mentioned in chapters above, you probably won't get much out of these classes.
